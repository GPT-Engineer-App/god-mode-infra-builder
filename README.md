#### 1. **Setting Up the Infrastructure**

**Objective:**
Create a scalable and robust infrastructure to support the advanced capabilities of God Mode.

**Steps:**

1. **Cloud Services:**
   - Use a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable computing resources.
   - Set up Kubernetes for container orchestration.

2. **Quantum Computing Integration:**
   - Utilize cloud-based quantum computing services such as IBM Q Experience or Amazon Braket.

3. **AI and Machine Learning:**
   - Set up TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI model development.
   - Use Nvidia GPUs for high-performance computing.

**Infrastructure Setup:**

```bash
# AWS CLI installation
pip install awscli

# Kubernetes setup
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/deployment.yaml

# IBM Q Experience setup (Python SDK)
pip install qiskit
```

#### 2. **Quantum Computing Integration**

**Objective:**
Integrate quantum computing capabilities for enhanced processing power.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Qiskit:**
   - Qiskit is a Python library for quantum computing.

2. **Develop Quantum Algorithms:**
   - Create and run quantum circuits for specific tasks.

**Quantum Integration Code:**

```python
from qiskit import Aer, QuantumCircuit, execute

def initialize_quantum_processor():
    backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
    qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
    qc.h(0)
    qc.cx(0, 1)
    qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])
    result = execute(qc, backend).result()
    return result.get_counts(qc)

quantum_result = initialize_quantum_processor()
print(quantum_result)
```

#### 3. **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Development**

**Objective:**
Build advanced AI systems capable of general intelligence tasks.

**Steps:**

1. **Install TensorFlow:**
   - TensorFlow is a widely used library for machine learning and AI.

2. **Develop Neural Networks:**
   - Create deep learning models for various applications.

**AGI Development Code:**

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Flatten, Conv2D
from tensorflow.keras import Model

class AGIModel(Model):
    def __init__(self):
        super(AGIModel, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu')
        self.flatten = Flatten()
        self.d1 = Dense(128, activation='relu')
        self.d2 = Dense(10, activation='softmax')

    def call(self, x):
        x = self.conv1(x)
        x = self.flatten(x)
        x = self.d1(x)
        return self.d2(x)

# Initialize and compile the model
model = AGIModel()
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Dummy data for illustration
train_data, train_labels = tf.random.normal([1000, 28, 28, 1]), tf.random.uniform([1000], maxval=10, dtype=tf.int64)
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=5)
```

#### 4. **Cosmic Networking**

**Objective:**
Establish connections with cosmic data sources and future technologies.

**Steps:**

1. **Connect to Satellite Data:**
   - Use APIs provided by space agencies like NASA or ESA.

2. **Develop Interdimensional Protocols:**
   - Design communication protocols for future data integration.

**Cosmic Networking Code:**

```python
import requests

def connect_to_cosmic_data_sources():
    nasa_api = "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY"
    response = requests.get(nasa_api)
    data = response.json()
    return data

cosmic_data = connect_to_cosmic_data_sources()
print(cosmic_data)
```

#### 5. **Exponential Scaling and Optimization**

**Objective:**
Optimize the system for exponential growth and performance.

**Steps:**

1. **Scalable Architecture:**
   - Use microservices architecture with Docker and Kubernetes.

2. **Resource Optimization:**
   - Implement advanced resource management using Kubernetes.

3. **Edge Computing:**
   - Deploy edge computing solutions to reduce latency.

**Scaling and Optimization Code:**

```yaml
# Kubernetes Deployment Example
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: agi-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agi
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: agi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: agi-container
        image: tensorflow/tensorflow:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
